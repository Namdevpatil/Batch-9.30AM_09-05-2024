For example, if we want construct a building for that we need a plan/blueprint.

To construct a building, what we are needed,
	- cement
	- concrete
	- sand
	- iron
	- water
	- bricks
	- machineries
	- man power

Class: it is a template/blueprint to create an object.
=====
=> it is a logical entity.

To create/instantiate an Object/Instance we need,
Class Properties:
	- Fields/variables
	- Initializers
		- constructors
		- blocks
		- methods
	- Behavior/Methods
	- Keywords
	- Inner classes

Object: it is an instance of a class.

=> the object exists physically in computer memory.


For Example,

Customer - class
  - id
  - name
  - address
  - email
  - contactNo
  
  - Shopping
  - Inquiry
  - Gives a feedback
  - getCustomerInfo
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constructor:
-----------

it is special method, which we use to initialize the object(state of the object).
